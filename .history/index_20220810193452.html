                           <p>It's November 6, 1983 in Hawkins, a small Indiana town.</p>
                           <p>
                              In the Hawkins National Laboratory, run by the Department of Energy, a scientist is
                              attacked by an unseen creature. Elsewhere, 12-year-old Will Byers is playing a round of
                              Dungeons & Dragons with his friends Mike Wheeler, Lucas Sinclair, and Dustin Henderson.
                              When he bicycles home after the game, he encounters the creature from the laboratory and
                              disappears.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              The next day, Will's mother Joyce and his older brother Jonathan notice his absence. Joyce
                              contacts the local chief of police, Jim Hopper, who tries to assure her that nothing
                              exciting ever happens in Hawkins, and that Will is probably with his father. But at
                              Joyce's insistence, Hopper and deputies do a search near the local woods and find Will's
                              abandoned bike, causing Hopper to suspect that foul play might actually be involved.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              Meanwhile, Mike's older sister Nancy is in an increasingly serious relationship with local
                              high school heartthrob, Steve Harrington, despite the misgivings of her best friend,
                              Barbara Holland, who thinks Steve is only trying to get into Nancy's pants. Her attempts
                              to meet up with Steve in secret is hindered by Will's disappearance, as her and Mike's
                              mother, Karen, refuses to let her go outside unsupervised as long as Will is still
                              missing.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              Elsewhere, a buzz-cut young girl wearing a hospital gown steals food from a local diner.
                              The owner, Benny, takes pity on her and feeds her before calling social services. From a
                              tattoo on her arm, he learns that her name is Eleven. A woman posing as a social worker
                              arrives and murders Benny. Armed men search the diner for Eleven, but she escapes.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              That evening, Joyce believes she hears Will's voice on a distorted phone call, but her
                              phone short circuits. Meanwhile, Mike, Dustin, and Lucas decide to undertake a search for
                              Will of their own. As they explore the woods, they stumble upon Eleven.

                              The boys bring Eleven to Mike's house, where she sleeps in the basement. Lucas and Dustin
                              are hesitant to involve themselves with Eleven, finding her strange and a distraction from
                              finding Will, but Mike convinces them he will arrange for Eleven to approach his mother so
                              that she can contact the authorities.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              The next day, Mike nicknames her "El". She refuses to meet Mike's parents, warning Mike
                              that involving anyone else risks attracting the attention of dangerous people. Scientists
                              from the laboratory find a substance oozing from the walls of Joyce's home. At Mike's
                              home, Eleven recognizes and points out Will in a photo before turning the boys' D&D game
                              board upside down to indicate to them that is where he is.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              As the community searches for Will, under the coordination of Hopper and the local police,
                              Mr. Clarke, the boys' science teacher, discovers a scrap of a hospital gown outside the
                              laboratory grounds. Hopper, meanwhile, is also tasked with investigating Benny's rather
                              suspicious "suicide". Hearing from witnesses that a child in a gown was stealing food from
                              the dinner yesterday, Hopper suspects that it might be connected to Will's disappearance
                              and decides to take a closer look at the laboratory.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              Under pretext of going to an assembly regarding Will's disappearance, Nancy goes with
                              Barbara to a party at Steve's house.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              Jonathan goes on a short trip out of town to visit his and Will's deadbeat father, Lonnie,
                              but learns nothing from him about Will's whereabouts. An unhappy Jonathan returns to
                              Hawkins that evening and goes into the woods with his camera to take some pictures of
                              nature where he finds Steve, Nancy, and their friends roughhousing around Steve's swimming
                              pool, shotgunning beer cans. Nancy successfully downs her can, but when Bard is
                              peer-pressured into doing the same, she accidentally cuts herself trying to pierce the
                              can. Uncomfortable with her peers' drunken antics, Barbara remains alone by the swimming
                              pool as they go inside, a drop of blood from her cut falling into the water. Jonathan sees
                              her and takes a picture of her, but when he looks away to change his film, Barb hears the
                              flickering of the pool's electrical outdoor lights behind her and a soft growling, turning
                              around just as an otherworldly monster lunges at her. Jonathan looks up from his camera,
                              the pool's diving board is empty, with no trace of Barb or the monster anywhere.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              Joyce receives another call from Will, hears music from his room, and sees something
                              coming through the wall.

                              off.

                              Hawkins Lab director Dr. Martin Brenner allows Hopper and his deputies to view the lab's
                              security camera footage to prove that Will hasn't been near the lab, but Hopper realizes
                              it is fake. He decides to take Deputy Powell with him to visit the local library to
                              research Hawkins Lab. He finds that Brenner has been involved in several shady government
                              projects studying the supernatural and that a woman named Terry Ives once accused Brenner
                              of stealing her daughter. Though Deputy Powell is skeptical, Hopper insists that it is
                              worth looking closer into.

                              Eleven has a flashback in which Brenner, whom she calls "Papa," has her put in solitary
                              confinement for refusing to telekinetically harm a cat. When she in her panic uses her
                              powers to kill the two orderlies manhandling her, Brenner is impressed.

                              Nancy worries about Barb, who is missing. Steve and his friends discover that Jonathan
                              took photographs of their house party. They gang up on him and destroy the photos and his
                              camera. Nancy, however, discovers the picture of Barb by the poolside amongst the torn
                              photographs and returns to Steve's house to search for her.

                              Will using the lights, which he uses to tell her that he is alive but unsafe. He tells
                              Joyce to run as a creature begins to climb through her wall. Will's apparent body is
                              discovered in the water at a quarry.

                              Eleven proves to the boys that Will is still alive by channelling his voice through Mike's
                              walkie-talkie. The boys realise that they need stronger equipment than a walkie-talkie if
                              they want to contact Will, so they give Eleven a makeover so they can sneak her into the
                              school. At school, Eleven uses Mr. Clarke's ham radio to channel Will talking to his
                              mother.

                              it is Will. She has a heated argument with Jonathan, who accuses her of being in denial,
                              as he tells her that they need accept that Will is dead and give him a proper funeral.
                              Later she hears Will in her living room wall. Tearing away the wallpaper, she sees him
                              behind a membrane. Will tries to explain the strange nature of the place he is stuck in,
                              but has to flee as the monster returns for him. Joyce demolishes the wall with an axe but

                              figure with long arms and no face, and he begins to consider that Joyce might actually be
                              telling the truth. Nancy tells the police about her missing friend and subsequently admits
                              to her mother that she slept with Steve. When she tells Steve about the police, she is
                              irritated that he cares only about not getting in trouble with his father.

                              He wakes at home and discovers a hidden microphone. His deputies pay him a visit to inform
                              him that Barb's car was found, but Hopper finds the state's involvement suspicious.

                              The boys determine Will is trapped in an alternate dimension Eleven calls the "Upside
                              Down," and he is being pursued by a monster similar to a Demogorgon. After Will's funeral,
                              the boys ask their science teacher Mr. Clarke about alternative dimensions. He explains
                              that a high-energy spacetime tear could theoretically create a passage between dimensions,
                              and that such a phenomenon would create a disruption in the Earth's electromagnetic field.
                              Using their compasses, the party heads into the woods to search for such a disruption.
                              Eleven remembers encountering the creature during a lab experiment, and afraid, she
                              redirects the compasses. Lucas notices and confronts her. Mike defends her, he and Lucas
                              fight, and Eleven telekinetically flings Lucas off Mike. While Dustin and Mike tend to the
                              unconscious Lucas, Eleven disappears.

                              about his sons, but is really just trying to cash in on Will's death with a wrongful death
                              lawsuit. Angry, she demands that he leaves again.

                              to the case. They track down Terry Ives, who is catatonic and tended by her sister Becky.

                              Being interrogated at Hawkins Lab, Hopper manages to negotiate a deal with Brenner. He
                              gives up the location of Eleven; in exchange he and Joyce are allowed to enter the Upside
                              Down to attempt to save Will. They find Will unconscious in the Upside-Down town library.
                              They pull a tendril out of his throat, perform CPR, and revive him.

                              TNancy and Jonathan booby-trap the Byerses' home, then cut their hands to attract the
                              monster with their blood. Steve arrives, intending to apologize to Jonathan about their
                              fight, but the monster attacks. The monster springs the trap but escapes back to the
                              Upside Down. Eleven and the boys hide in the middle school.

                              Mike asks Eleven to a school dance, the Snow Ball, and kisses her. The military storms the
                              school to re-capture Eleven, but she kills them, before collapsing from the strain
                              afterwards. As Brenner cradles her, the monster attacks, apparently killing him. The boys
                              hide Eleven in a classroom. The monster corners them, but Eleven pins it against a wall.
                              She says goodbye to Mike, disintegrates the monster, and vanishes.

                              Will is hospitalized and reunited with his mother, brother, and friends. Happy that all
                              seems well, Hopper steps outside the hospital for a smoke, but as he does so, a black car
                              pulls up to him and two government agents step out, beckoning him to enter the car.
                              Reluctantly, he enters it and is driven off.

                              One month later, at Christmas time, Nancy and Steve are back together, and both are
                              friends with Jonathan. Hopper is seen leaving Eggo waffles and other food in a box in the
                              woods. At the Byerses' household, Will excuses himself from the Christmas dinner to go to
                              the bathroom. There he coughs up a slug-like creature into the sink and has a vision of
                              the world as the Upside Down, but he hides this from his family.

                              On October 28, 1984, a gang of teenagers commit a high profile robbery in Pittsburgh. The
                              police pursue them through the streets, but the gang is successful in getting away when
                              one of the members uses psychic powers to aid their escape. A wrist tattoo marks the
                              member as "008."

                              The party meet up the Hawkins arcade, where Dustin is upset to learn that someone with the
                              moniker "MADMAX", has toppled all of his highscores. Meanwhile, Will has a vision of the
                              Upside Down, seeing a violent storm approaching in the distance.

                              Journalist Murray Bauman is snooping around Hawkins, having heard rumors about Eleven and
                              her powers, believing that he is on the heels of some sort of conspiracy involving a
                              secret Russian weapon. Hopper, knowing better, tries to discourage Bauman from looking
                              deeper into the matter, while he himself investigates a mysterious blight on Bob Merrill's
                              pumpkin patch.

                              little investigation, and find out that she is the "MADMAX" from the arcade, making them
                              interested in recruiting her for the party. They decide to do this behind the back of
                              Mike, who has been in a really bad mood ever since Eleven's disappearance.

                              At Hawkins Lab, the new head scientist on duty, Dr. Sam Owens, examines Will after his
                              vision. He tells Joyce that Will is probably just experiencing post-traumatic stress
                              disorder. Joyce, meanwhile, has gotten a new boyfriend, Bob Newby, a mild-mannered
                              technician, who Will has taken quite a shine to, while Jonathan is more skeptical.

                              him. Hopper moves her into his grandfather's old hunting cabin, telling her it is the
                              safest place for the time being. In the present, Hopper refuses to allow Eleven outside,
                              telling her that it is still not safe. Angry with his stalling, she leaves the cabin
                              during the daytime and goes looking for Mike.

                              taps out, "CLOSE GATE." The house phone rings, and Will realizes where he is. The Mind
                              Flayer sends a Demodog to the house, but Eleven arrives and kills it.

                              the group leaves in Billy's car. They start a fire in the tunnels, but Dart blocks their

                              the Snow Ball. Max and Lucas kiss, as do Mike and Eleven. Nancy pities Dustin and dances
                              with him. In the Upside Down, the Mind Flayer towers over the school.

                              It's summer in Hawkins, and up to now, things have been going great for the main
                              characters. Hopper and Eleven are still living in the cabin, apparently finding it a
                              better alternative than returning to Hopper's crappy trailer, but Eleven is no longer a
                              prisoner there and is free to leave to be with her friends whenever she wants and have
                              them come visit her (well, mostly Mike).
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              Lucas and Max also have a good relationship, and Dustin, upon returning from summer camp,
                              reveals that he also now has a girlfriend named Suzie, who lives in Utah. He asks the
                              party to go with him on an expedition to outskirts of Hawkins to set up a radio antenna,
                              so he can talk with her over the radio he constructed at the science camp and formally
                              introduce her to the party.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              Jonathan and Nancy now have summer jobs at newspaper reporters. Nancy, however, suffers
                              under an extremely sexist work environment and being saddled with menial tasks, and is
                              hoping to find a big story that will kickstart her career. Billy, meanwhile, has found a
                              job too, as a lifeguard, and a strict one at that.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              Steve has moved on from Nancy, but has, much to his chagrin, been unsuccessful in the
                              field of romance ever since. To make matters worse, his father has forced him to pick up a
                              summer job too under threat of withholding his college fund, so he now works at the ice
                              cream parlor at the newly opened Starcourt mall. He gets on well with his co-worker,
                              Robin, however, and is trying his best to impress her.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              But near the fourth of July, things start to go south. Hopper feels that Mike and Eleven
                              are spending too much time together. He seeks advice from Joyce, who encourages him to
                              talk it out politely with the young couple. But when they don't respond respectfully to
                              his attempt to do this, he takes Mike aside and scares him into backing off. What's worse,
                              while Dustin's new radio fails to contact Suzie, it does pick up a Soviet broadcast that
                              seems very close by... and Will senses of something wrong have been acting up
                              again...especially whenever he's in Starcourt Mall.

                              Dustin and Steve reunited at the ice cream shop. He showed Steve that he had recorded an
                              intercepted message in Russian. Dustin wanted Steve to help translate the message with a
                              dictionary. Steve's coworker, Robin, convinced Dustin to let her help with translation.
                              What they were able to translate seemed inconsequential. As they left the mall, Steve
                              realized the music he heard on the recording was the same music from a horse kiddie ride.

                              After Hopper threatened Mike, he lied to Eleven about not being able to see her. Eleven
                              went to Max for advice. The girls went to the mall to shop, despite Eleven being not
                              allowed around so many people. Meanwhile, Mike, Lucas, and Will went to the mall to help
                              Mike find a gift for Eleven. Max and Eleven saw the boys at the mall. Eleven confronted
                              Mike about his lying and broke up with him.

                              Hopper wanted to celebrate“the talk” going well through dinner with Joyce. He didn't tell
                              her that he went off script. Unfortunately, Hopper needed to leave for City Hall. Mayor
                              Larry Kline wanted Hopper to disperse and arrest the protestors. They were protesting the
                              opening of the Starcourt mall, which led to downtown businesses losing customers.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              Joyce never showed up to dinner. Instead, she visited Mr. Clarke to find out why the
                              magnets on her fridge were unsticking.

                              Nancy used the sexism against her to get away from work to investigate the tip about the
                              rats. She took Jonathan with her to see Mrs.Driscoll. Rats had eaten fertilizer that she
                              had just purchased. Mrs. Driscoll had caught one of the rats. It was violently throwing
                              itself against the cage as Jonathan tried to take a picture. Nancy pulled Jonathan away
                              just as the rat exploded and its liquefied remains rolled out of the cage.

                              Billy had ended up in the Upside Down where a group of shadows came upon him. A figure
                              stepped forward that looked exactly like him. It wanted to build what he sees. Billy
                              showed up at the pool for work the next day, however he was not acting like himself. Mrs.
                              Wheeler tried to explain to him that she didn't meet him because she had a family. He
                              imagined hurting her but just brushed her aside. On the lifeguard stand, he seemed
                              disoriented.

                              Seemingly under control by something, Billy kidnapped his fellow lifeguard. He told her to

                              El used her abilities to spy on the boys talking about not understanding women. Max and El
                              spun a bottle to pick who to spy on next, and it landed on Billy. Eleven saw Billy hunched
                              over Heather, who was in distress. Billy saw El watching him. Max and El checked the pool,
                              and neither Billy nor Heather had shown up to work.

                              They tracked down Heather and Billy, who were having dinner at the Holloways'. Everything
                              seemed normal, so Max and El left. In possession of the Mindflayer's memories, Billy
                              remembered when Eleven closed the gate. Heather's mother, Janet, collapsed after being
                              poisoned. Billy knocked out her father, Tom, the owner of The Hawkins Post.

                              Will woke Mike and Lucas dressed as his Dungeons and Dragons character. He wanted them to
                              play, but they participated half-heartedly. Will was fed up with them, and they pointed
                              out that they were growing up. He left in the rain and ended up at his hideout in the
                              woods. Will remembered his friends together as they had been and ripped a photo of them
                              dressed as the Ghostbusters. He tore up his D&D drawings and destroyed the hideout with a
                              baseball bat.

                              When Mike and Lucas couldn't find Will at his house, they went to the hideout. Will warned
                              them that the Mindflayer was back.

                              With the Russian message fully translated, Robin was working out what it meant. Knowing
                              that the music came from the mall, Robin was able to connect the message to the mall too.
                              With the information, Dustin, Steve, and Robin saw boxes delivered under the watch of
                              armed guards, presumably the Russians.

                              The men at The Hawkins Post laughed at Nancy's fertilizer rat story. Nancy determined she
                              needed to bring them proof. She and Jonathan visited Mrs. Driscoll. They found her in her
                              basement eating fertilizer.

                              Joyce arrived at Hopper's. She had forgotten that she was supposed to meet him for dinner.
                              Joyce explained that she was at Mr. Clarke's to figure out why the magnets weren't
                              sticking. Hopper was jealous of Mr. Clarke. Joyce explained that it would take
                              considerable resources to build something that would disrupt magnetic fields on a big
                              enough scale. She thought something was going on back at the now-closed lab.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              Hopper reluctantly took her there. Joyce had flashbacks of Bob. Hopper confessed that he
                              knew she was trying to sell her house. They heard a noise, and someone beat up Hopper
                              until he was unconscious. Joyce found him as the assailant left.

                              The boys called a code red, and Will provided a theory for why he was feeling the Mind
                              Flayer. He believed that Eleven had closed the gate on the part that Joyce cast out of
                              him, trapping him on their side. After observing Billy, they planned to trap him in the
                              sauna and draw the Mind Flayer out with heat.
                           </p>

                              While in the sauna, Billy confessed to Max that a shadow made him do terrible things. He
                              tried to escape and choked Eleven. She used her powers to launch him through the wall.
                              Billy escaped with Heather driving. They retreated to the basement of the abandoned
                              Brimborn Steel Works, where other Flayed people stood with the Mind Flayer blob.

                              Robin got the official blueprints for the Starcourt mall. She discovered a way into the
                              guarded area from Scoops Ahoy! through the air ducts. Unfortunately, none of them could
                              fit. Dustin, Steve, and Robin promised Erica Sinclair free ice cream for life if she
                              crawled in to open the door for them. After she was successful, they found a box storing
                              containers of glowing, green matter. Soon after, they discovered that the room was an
                              elevator, which plunged downward.

                              Joyce tended to Hopper and offered a partial license plate of his attacker's vehicle. When
                              she revealed that the mysterious man left on a motorcycle, Hopper went straight to Mayor
                              Kline. Hopper remembered seeing a man in motorcycle gear leaving Kline's office. At first,
                              Kline acted ignorant, but Hopper quickly turned to violence to get answers. Kline admitted
                              that the man bribed him to approve land grants for Starcourt. Realizing the location of
                              the Starcourt properties, Joyce and Hopper believed that the experiments that messed with
                              Joyce's magnets came from them.

                              Nancy and Jonathan called the paramedics to help Mrs. Driscoll. The next day, newly Flayed
                              Tom reprimanded them in his office. He claimed that Mrs. Driscoll was a paranoid
                              schizophrenic and fired them. On the way home, Nancy wondered if Tom was on drugs.
                              Jonathan had had enough of Nancy. Nancy didn't need to work, but Jonathan did. They
                              wondered if they had anything in common anymore.

                              At home, Mrs. Wheeler encouraged Nancy to keep pursuing the story. She could sell it to a
                              bigger paper and show up The Hawkins Post. Nancy went to the hospital to visit Mrs.
                              Driscoll and looked at her chart.

                              Nancy called Jonathan to speak with Will. Mrs. Driscoll's charts showed that her body
                              temperature was down. The Mindflayer liked it cool. They found him at the Wheelers' with
                              Mike, Lucas, Max, and Eleven. Eleven was trying to find Hopper with her powers. They
                              shared information about Billy and Heather, who, Nancy realized, could've gotten to Tom.
                              At the Holloways, they found the aftermath of the attack on Heather's parents. They found
                              evidence of ingested chemicals and realized the Flayed were creating new substances with
                              their bodies. In the garage, they saw that Billy and Heather had taken the Holloways to a
                              secondary location.
                           </p>

                              As a group, they went back to the hospital. They wanted to release Mrs. Driscoll and see
                              where she headed. The nurse at the reception desk only let Nancy and Jonathan through. It
                              was a trap. Bruce and Tom, both Flayed, attacked them. Nancy and Jonathan killed Bruce and
                              Tom. Both of their bodies liquefied and formed a monster.

                              Hopper and Joyce rolled up to the Hess farm. They found two Russians in a secret basement.
                              The motorcycle man arrived with an automatic weapon. Hopper and Joyce took one of the
                              scientists, Alexei, with them. They drove off as the thug shot at them.
                           </p>

                              In the woods, Hopper was trying to fix his broken-down Bronco, but it caught fire.
                              Abandoning it, they walked in the woods until they came upon a road and a gas station.
                              Hopper took possession of someone's convertible, and they drove to Illinois to see Murray
                              Bauman. He could speak Russian but was paranoid of Alexei.
                           </p>

                              Dustin and Steve climbed out of the top of the elevator. They were too far down to climb
                              up the elevator shaft. The signal on Dustin's radio wasn't making it through. The elevator
                              doors opened as two more Russians collected the delivered boxes. The green substance,
                              which Erica considered drinking, spilled and burned through metal and concrete. Robin,
                              Steve, Erica, and Dustin walked down a long hallway.

                              They made it into the room with the man on the radio. Robin tried to speak the Russian
                              words she had heard on the recording. Steve won his first fight. They found the glowing,
                              blue room where the Russians appeared to be opening a new gate.

                              Eleven saved Nancy, but the creature rejoined the main Mind Flayer form. The next day,
                              Eleven used her powers to locate any of the known Flayed. Mike and Max argued over what
                              was best for her. Though she wasn't in the room, Mike yelled that he loved her to everyone

                              When El located Billy, he was just staying in his room for the Fourth of July. They all
                              reasoned that it was a trap. Eleven wanted to go into Billy's memories, like what happened
                              with her mother in the previous season. While in his memories, she saw Billy's rough
                              childhood. El discovered that the Mind Flayer was at Brimborn Steelworks, but the Mind
                              Flayer now knew where she was too. At the end of the episode, the Flayed were liquefying
                              and joining the Mind Flayer's body.

                              Hopper got Alexei some burgers and a strawberry Slurpee. Unfortunately, Alexei wanted
                              cherry and refused to drink it, thinking he had the upper hand. Hopper threw him out with
                              the car keys, knowing that Alexei couldn't go back unharmed. It would look like he had
                              talked.

                              Through Bauman, Alexei explained that they were trying to use a “key” to open a “door”.
                              Essentially, they were trying to open the gate to the Upside Down. The door was currently
                              opening. Hopper promised to take Alexei to the key, but it was in the underground
                              fortress. He used a number that Dr. Owens gave him to call for reinforcements. Joyce
                              called them again and insisted they come at once.

                              The Soviet officer, who Steve beat up, regained consciousness and alerted the rest of the
                              facility. While helping Dustin and Erica escape, Steve and Robin got caught. The Russians
                              tied them together, back to back, in chairs. After they tipped over reaching for scissors,
                              Robin confessed that she was obsessed with him when she sat behind him in a class. Steve
                              hadn't even remembered her but assured her the popularity wasn't all that it was cracked
                              up to be.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              Meanwhile, Dustin and Erica found their way into a room storing the green substance. While
                              the Russians interrogated Robin and Steve under truth serum, Dustin and Erica used the
                              green substance as a distraction. They ambushed the interrogator with an electric prod.

                              The Mind Flayer headed for the cabin, and the group prepared for the attack. Tentacles
                              came through the cabin, and El was able to use her powers to tear them apart. It grabbed
                              her leg and held on. She split the Mind Flayer's “head” in half, and Mike tore the
                              tentacle off her leg, revealing a deep wound.
                           </p>

                              They all escaped the cabin and broke into a grocery store. Accustomed to gruesome injuries
                              from skateboarding, Max led the charge in treating Eleven's injury. When El was feeling
                              better, Mike was desperately trying to tell her how he feels about her. At that moment,
                              Dustin finally came through on the radio. Unfortunately, the batteries in Dustin's radio
                              were failing, and they couldn't get much information. They all left, and Lucas took an
                              arsenal of fireworks with him.

                              Dustin and Erica had to babysit drugged Robin and Steve, as they escaped the Russian
                              underground fortress. The Russians guarded the loading dock, so they ducked into the
                              Employees Only hallway. They snuck into the movie theater and into a showing of Back to
                              the Future. Unfortunately, they had to sit separately, and Dustin and Erica lost Steve and
                              Robin. They ran into the restroom to vomit. While on the restroom floor, Steve confessed
                              to Robin that he liked her. Unfortunately, when Robin had said she was obsessed with him,
                              it wasn't because she liked him. Robin liked a girl, who had liked him.

                              When the movie ended, Dustin, Erica, Steve, and Robin tried to blend with the crowd
                              exiting. However, the Russians were monitoring the crowd. They hid in the food court, but
                              when the Russians were close, the rest of the group arrived. Eleven flung a car at them.
                              Unfortunately, the reunion was cut short with Eleven in distress.

                              Joyce and Hopper wanted to go to the Fourth of July carnival to find their kids. In the
                              car on the way, they bickered, and Bauman remarked on their sexual tension. At the
                              carnival, Mayor Kline saw them and called in Russian reinforcements.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              Bauman and Alexei left the car against instructions. Alexei wanted to experience the
                              American traditions. While Bauman went to get corn dogs, Alexei won a stuffed prize by
                              playing balloon darts. On his way back to Bauman, Grigori found him and shot him in the
                              stomach with a silenced gun. Horrified, Bauman searched for Hopper and Joyce, who were
                              stuck in the Gravitron. When they got back to Alexei, he was dead, and the Russians were
                              after them. Hopper headed into the fun house, where he fought them.

                              A piece of the Mind Flayer's creation was embedded inside El's leg. After Jonathan tried
                              to get it out with a knife, Eleven used her powers to extract it. Right then, the adults
                              finally arrived. After everyone explained what had been going on, the adults formulated a
                              plan using Alexei's instructions. They would go down into the elevator to shut down the
                              Key. Dustin and Erica rightfully pointed out they needed them to show the way.

                              They were supposed to wait in safety at Bauman's. Unfortunately, Billy was waiting outside
                              in his car after he had sabotaged the station wagon. They ran back inside the mall, but
                              the monster came in through the glass ceiling. Will, Lucas, Jonathan and Nancy tried to
                              leave, and Billy almost rammed into them, if it wasn't for Steve. They escaped, but Billy
                              got a hold of Eleven. Lucas led the firework assault against the monster. However, it was
                              Eleven, who reminded Billy of the memory of his mother, that finally broke through. Billy
                              sacrificed himself to save them.

                              Scoop Troop, a.k.a. Dustin, Erica, Robin, and Steve, headed for Weathtertop, the hill
                              where Dustin kept Cerebro. After directing the Bald Eagle, Bauman, through the vents, the
                              adults were at a dead end with the passcode. It was supposed to be Planck's constant, but
                              the number was wrong. Dustin finally got Susie, who was real, on Cerebro. At Susie's
                              request, they sang “A Neverending Story” together, and she gave the right number.
                              Unfortunately, Grigori attacked as the gate was closing. Hopper defeated him but didn't
                              make it out when Joyce closed the gate. The Mind Flayer's body was dead. Because of Hopper
                              and Joyce's message, Dr. Owens and government agents swarmed the mall and the facility.

                              that she had heard him say he loved her. She loved him too. Will donated his Dungeons &
                              Dragons books; he could use Mike's when he was in town and would never join another party.
                              Joyce showed Eleven the heartfelt speech that Hopper was supposed to give her.

                              American in one of the cells and took a Russian scientist with them. They put him in a
                              cage and released a Demogorgon.

                              Club, an ongoing D&D game... which happens to have the climactic game of their campaign at
                              the same time as the championship match.

                              question What have you done? and we cut to Nancy watching Brenner tattoo Henry's arm.
                              Brenner addresses Nancy in Vecna's voice, and she runs into the Hawkins Lab hallway, site
                              of the massacre. The gang in Eddie's trailer frantically search for music to bring Nancy
                              back while she fights with the barriers Vecna has placed around the corridors. She is only
                              able to escape because Vecna has a message...for Eleven. When she gets back, the gang
                              prepare for a battle.

                              itself. They are able to find an air vent passageway that will lead them out of the
                              prison. Knowing those creatures are on the loose, they decide to return and kill them with

                              about Henry/One/Vecna. El realizes that her friends in Hawkins are in more danger than she
                              previously thought; Brenner confirms this with vivid, ghoulish description, prompting El
                              to look for them with her powers. Brenner double-crosses her, just in time for the
                              government to show up and pose a threat to them all.

                              The Hawkins kids devise a plan to defeat Vecna: Max, guarded by Lucas and Erica, will lure

                              but she gets the idea to psychically meet Vecna instead. The group takes over a pizza
                              place and creates a sensory deprivation tank with a freezer and salts. Over in Russia,
                              Joyce, Hopper, Murray, and Dmitri realize that the kids have some kind of plan. In order
                              to help them, the adults reinfiltrate the prison, aiming to destroy the Soviets'
                              Demogorgons and Demodogs.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              The Hawkins plan quickly goes south: Dustin and Eddie are able to lure away the Demobats
                              and hide in Eddie's trailer, but didn't think that they could enter through the vents.
                              Vecna quickly traps the teens, while Jason finds Lucas and assumes he is killing Max the
                              same way Chrissy died and attacks him, making him unable to rescue Max from Vecna's
                              clutches. Eleven finds Max and Vecna in the former's mind and is able to briefly fight
                              him, but is eventually outmatched. Vecna explains that he is able to control the particles
                              in the Upside Down to do his bidding (including the Mind Flayer).
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              Murray sets the Demogorgons and Demodogs on fire, which stuns and weakens Vecna enough to
                              release the teens. Hopper is able to kill the remaining Demogorgon. Steve, Robin, and
                              Nancy set Vecna on fire and push him out the window, freeing Max and Eleven, but his body
                              disappears. Eddie, who had returned to the Upside Down to continue luring the Demobats
                              away, is killed by them. Lucas is able to fight back against Jason, but is too late to
                              stop Vecna from brutalizing and killing Max. Eleven is barely able to resuscitate Max, but
                              the latter's clinical death still opens the gates, causing an earthquake that wreaks havoc
                              throughout Hawkins.

                              potentially the earthquake as well. Will, Mike, Eleven, Jonathan, and Argyle arrive in
                              Hawkins and are reunited with the others; the group sets about refurbishing Hopper's
                              cottage in the woods when Joyce and Hopper are dropped off by government agents. After all
                              the happy reunions, Will admits tha he can still feel Vecna out and about despite the
                              latter's physical form being destroyed, and is apparently proven right when "snow" from
                              the Upside Down starts falling around Hawkins. The group observes a decaying field as the
                              horizon is tinted a sickeningly familiar shade of red, bearing witness to the armies of
                              Hell as they unleash an all-out assault on the world.
